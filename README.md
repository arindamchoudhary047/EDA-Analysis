Exploratory Analysis Of Global Rising Temperatures

I will be putting all the inferences and conclusions I obtained from the dataset in this README. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities)

1. Which year had the highest and lowest global average temperature?

Ans:  2016 was hottest, 1996 was coldest.

3. Is there an overall warming trend?
   
Ans: There is a general rise in temperature over the years with some drops in 2008 and 2013. For better visualization, graph is available in eda.ipynb file.

5. Which year had the largest range of temperature (max - min)?
   
Ans: 1999 with a range of 158.1 F

7. How much has the global avg changed from 1995 to 2019?
   
Ans: 3.358628 F

9. Which region has the highest and lowest temperatures overall?
    
Ans: Africa is hottest and Europe is coldest

11. Most stable and unstable temperatures are in which region?
    
Ans: South Central America And Caribbean have the most stable, while most unstable is Asia with Australia/South Pacific coming in very close. For better visualization, graph is available in eda.ipynb file.

13. Do all regions show similiar global warming trends over time?

Ans: Yes, all of the regions have similiar peaks and dips in global warming trend graphs. For better visualization, graph is available in eda.ipynb file.

14. Which month is globally hottest and coldest on average?

Ans: January is coldest with December being close. July is the hottest month.

15. Do Northern and Southern Hemisphere have opposite seasonal patterns?
 
Ans: Yes. The Northern and Southern Hemispheres have opposite seasonal patterns. For example, Australia and the South Pacific show colder temperatures in July, indicating they are in the Southern Hemisphere where winter occurs during the Northern Hemisphereâ€™s summer. In contrast, most other regions (e.g., Europe, Asia, North America) are hottest in July and coldest in January/December, characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. Africa and South America/Caribbean show minimal seasonal variation, suggesting they lie near the equator where temperatures remain relatively constant year-round.

16. Which city and region have showed the highest/lowest ever recorded avg temperatures?

Ans: Hottest: Middle East, Kuwait, Aug 1st 2012, 110 F
     Coldest: North America, US, Fairbanks, 12 December 1999, -50 F

17. Are extreme heat events increasing over time?
    
Ans: Considering extreme heat events as temperatures over 100F, the number of events are generally increasing with dips in 2004 and 2014. For better visualization, graph is available in eda.ipynb file.

18. Which region has the fastest global warming?

Ans: Middle East.
